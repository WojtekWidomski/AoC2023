# Advent of code 2023

My solutions for AoC 2023.

First 5 days are written in Python or C++. The next days are in Rust. (Folders day5-24 are Cargo projects without version control, created using `cargo new --vcs none dayX`). In some days part 2 is in separate binary crate.

Not all tasks are complete.
